# End-to-End Flight Operations Data Engineering Project using Apache Airflow

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data engineering pipeline** for flight operations data using **Apache Airflow**. The pipeline automates data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) from flight data sources into a structured database for analysis.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Extracts flight and aircraft data from external APIs
- Cleans and transforms raw data using Python
- Loads the processed data into a PostgreSQL database
- Orchestrates workflows using Apache Airflow DAGs
- Runs automatically on a scheduled basis
